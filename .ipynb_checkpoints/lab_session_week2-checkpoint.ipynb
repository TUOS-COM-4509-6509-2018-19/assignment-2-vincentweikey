    "In last week's class we saw how we could load in a data set to pandas and use it for some simple data processing. We computed various probabilities on the data and I encouraged you to think about what sort of probabilities you need for prediction. This week we are going to take a slightly different tack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking there are two dominating approaches to machine learning problems. We started to consider the first approach last week: constructing models based on defining the relationship between variables using probabilities. This week we will consider the second approach: which involves defining an *objective function* and optimizing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by an objective function? An objective function could be an *error function*, a *cost function* or a *benefit* function. In evolutionary computing they are called *fitness* functions. But the idea is always the same. We write down a mathematical equation which is then optimized to do the learning. The equation should be a function of the *data* and our model *parameters*. We have a choice when optimizing, either minimize or maximize. To avoid confusion, in the optimization field, we always choose to minimize the function. If we have a function that we would like to maximize, we simply choose to minimize the negative of that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for this lab session, we are going to ignore probabilities, but don't worry, they will return! \n",
    "\n",

    "In Sheffield we have written a suite of software tools for 'Open Data Science'. Open data science is an approach to sharing code, models and data that should make it easier for companies, health professionals and scientists to gain access to data science techniques. For some background on open data science you can read [this blog post](http://inverseprobability.com/2014/07/01/open-data-science/). The first thing we will do this week is to download that suite of software. \n",

    "## Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system aims to make suggestions for items (films, books, other commercial products) given what it knows about users' tastes. The recommendation engine needs to represent the *taste* of all the users and the *characteristics* of each object. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common way for organizing objects is to place related objects spatially close together. For example in a library we try and put books that are on related topics near to each other on the shelves. One system for doing this is known as [Dewey Decimal Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification). In the Dewey Decimal Classification system (which dates from 1876) each subject is given a number (in fact it's a decimal number). For example, the field of Natural Sciences and Mathematics is given numbers which start with 500. Subjects based on Computer Science are given numbers which start 004 and works on the 'mathematical principles' of Computer science are given the series 004.0151 (which we might store as 4.0151 on a Computer). Whilst it's a classification system, the books in the library are typically laid out in the same order as the numbers, so we might expect that neighbouring numbers represent books that are related in subject. That seems to be exactly what we want when also representing films. Could we somehow represent each film's subject according to a number? In a similar way we could then imagine representing users with a list of numbers that represent things that each user is interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually a one dimensional representation of a subject can be very awkward. To see this, let's have a look at the Dewey Decimal Classification numbers for the 900s, which is listed as 'History and Geography'. We will focus on subjects in the 940s which can be found in this list from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#Class_900_%E2%80%93_History_&_geography). Whilst the ordering for places is somewhat sensible, it is also rather arbitrary. In the 940s we have Europe listed from 940-949, Asia listed from 950-959 and Africa listed from 960-969. Whilst it's true that Asia borders Europe, Africa is also very close, and the history of the Roman Empire spreads into [Carthage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage) and later on Egypt. This image from Wikipedia shows a map of the Cathaginian Empire which fell after fighting with Rome. \n",

    "<a title=\"By Javierfv1212 [Public domain], from Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carthaginianempire.PNG\"><img width=\"512\" alt=\"Carthaginianempire\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Carthaginianempire.PNG/512px-Carthaginianempire.PNG\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to make a decision about whether Roman Histories are European or African, ideally we'd like them to be somewhere between the two, but we can't place them there in the Dewey Decimal system because between Europe and Africa is Asia, which has less to do with the Roman Empire than either Europe or Africa. Of course the fact that we've used a map provides a clue as to what to do next. Libraries are actually laid out on floors, so what if we were to use the spatial lay out to organise the sujbects of the books in two dimensions. Books on Geography could be laid out according to where in the world they are referring to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such complexities are very hard to encapsulate in one number, but inspired by the map examples we can start considering how we might lay out films in two dimensions. Similarly, we can consider laying out a map of people's interests. If the two maps correspond to one another, the map of people could reflect where they might want to live in 'subject space'. We can think of representing people's tastes as where they might best like to sit in the library to access easily the books they are most interested in.\n",

    "## Inner Products for Representing Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas like the above are good for gaining intuitions about what we might want, but the one of the skills of data science is representing those ideas mathematically. Mathematical abstraction of a problem is one of the key ways in which we've been able to progress as a society. Understanding planetary motions, as well as those of the smallest molecule (to quote Laplace's [Philosophical Essay on Probabilities](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1YQPAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)) needed to be done mathematically. The right mathematical model in machine learning can be slightly more elusive, because constructing it is a two stage process. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have to determine the right intuition for the system we want to represent. Notions such as 'subject' and 'interest' are not mathematically well defined, and even when we create a new interpretation of what they might mean, each interpretation may have its own weaknesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once we have our interpretation we can attempt to mathematically formalize it. In our library interpretation, that's what we need to do next. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Library on an Infinite Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a library which stores all the items  we are interested in, not just books, but films and shopping items too. Such a library is likely to be very large, so we'll create it on an infinite two dimensional plane. This means we can use all the real numbers to represent the location of each item on the plane. For a two dimensional plane, we need to store the locations in a vector of numbers: we can decide that the $j$th item's location in the library is given by \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_j = \\begin{bmatrix} v_{j,1} \\\\ v_{j,2}\\end{bmatrix},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v_{j,1}$ represents the $j$th item's location in the East-West direction (or the $x$-axis) and $v_{j,2}$ represents the $j$th item's location in the North-South direction (or the $y$-axis). Now we need to specify the location where each user sits so that all the items that interest them are nearby: we can also represent the $i$th user's location with a vector \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}_i = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{i,1} \\\\ u_{i,2}\\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Finally, we need some way of recording a given user's affinity for a given item. This affinity might be the rating that the user gives the film. We can use $y_{i,j}$ to represent user $i$'s affinity for item $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our film example we might imagine wanting to order films in a few ways. We could imagine organising films in the North-South direction as to how romantic they are. We could place the more romantic films further North and the less romantic films further South. For the East-West direction we could imagine ordering them according to how historic they are: we can imagine placing science fiction films to the East and historical drama to the West. In this case, fans of historical romances would be based in the North-West location, whilst fans of Science Fiction Action films might be located in the South-East (if we assume that 'Action' is the opposite of 'Romance', which is not necessarily the case). How do we lay out all these films? Have we got the right axes? In machine learning the answer is to 'let the data speak'. Use the data to try and obtain such a lay out. To do this we first need to obtain the data."

    "## Is Our Map Enough? Are Our Data Enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is two dimensions really enough to capture the complexity of humans and their artforms? Perhaps we need even more dimensions to capture that complexity. Extending our books analogy further, consider how we should place books that have a historical timeframe as well as some geographical location. Do we really want books from the 2nd World War to sit alongside books from the Roman Empire? Books on the American invasion of Sicily in 1943 are perhaps less related to books about Carthage than those that study the Jewish Revolt from 66-70 (in the Roman Province of Judaea). So books that relate to subjects which are closer in time should be stored together. However, a student of rebellion against empire may also be interested in the relationship between the Jewish Revolt of 66-70 and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, nearly 1800 years later. Whilst the technologies are different, the psychology of the people is shared: a rebellious nation angainst their imperial masters, triggered by misrule with a religious and cultural background. To capture such complexities we would need further dimensions in our latent representation. But are further dimensions justified by the amount of data we have? Can we really understand the facets of a film that only has at most three or four ratings?"
